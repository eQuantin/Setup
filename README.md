install command : sudo sh -c "$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eQuantin/Setup/master/setup.sh)"

ISSUE :
  - install process is user name dependant
  - if wallpapers directory already exist git will not clone wallpapers repo
  - script should ask to logout at the end even if user change his shell
  - vsc --user-data-dir not specified
  
 TO DO: 
  - sync directory
  - uninstall script
  - version lock
  - sync versions
  - wallpapers should be a sync directory
  - set hotkeys
  - git configuration
  - gnome configuration
